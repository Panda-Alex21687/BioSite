    <h2>About Tyler</h2>
    
    <p>I like to think of myself as calm and laid-back; though I can get a little spontaneous when the moment calls for it. I’ve lived in Tennessee my whole life; born, raised, and still here; and most of my days are spent grinding through long, exhausting work hours. But when the day ends, I love retreating to my little corner of the world; relaxing, and resetting for whatever comes next.</p>
    <p>Art has always been a part of me. I still remember standing on that stage in 8th grade, hearing my name called for first place at the art award ceremony; that moment stuck with me; it was more than just a ribbon or a certificate; it was proof that my creativity could make an impact. Even though gaming has taken up a lot of my free time these days, I find myself daydreaming about picking up a brush again; sketching or painting something that comes straight from my imagination. Creativity is still alive in me, even if life sometimes nudges it to the side.</p>
    <p>I’m the kind of person who’s motivated by what’s ahead; by possibilities. I don’t have a single, specific long-term goal I’m chasing right now, but I’ve always believed in committing to what you start and not giving up halfway. That mindset has carried me through challenges; like the time I got stranded on a boat in the middle of a lake. I had to swim and push it back to shore; it was exhausting and terrifying, but it reminded me that staying calm and figuring things out can get you through almost anything.</p>
    <p>Two teachers left a lasting mark on me; my 9th-grade art teacher and my 9th-grade biology teacher. They encouraged me to explore my passions and challenged me to see things differently. I still carry lessons from them in the way I approach both life and work.</p>
    <p>But more than anything, I value laughter, friendships, and the small, shared moments that turn into memories. People often joke that I live for dad jokes; like the time I told everyone I dreamed I was floating in a “Fanta sea.” Those little moments of humor; those bursts of joy; are what make life fun and meaningful to me. I try to bring a little positivity and light into every day; whether it’s through a joke, a smile, or just being there for someone.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, that’s really me; a Tennessean, a creator, a problem-solver, a friend, and someone who tries to make life a little brighter; one laugh, one sketch, or one small memory at a time.</p>
