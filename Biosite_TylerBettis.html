        <h2>About Tyler</h2>
        <p>Tyler Bettis is a 33-year-old Tennessean who has lived in the state his entire life. He’s someone I would describe as calm, laid-back, and thoughtful, but also spontaneous when the moment calls for it. His days usually involve long, exhausting work hours, followed by relaxing evenings at home where he can unwind and reset.</p>

        <p>One thing that really stands out about Tyler is his creative side. Art has always been important to him, and one of his proudest moments was earning first place at his 8th-grade art award ceremony. Even though gaming is one of his main hobbies now, he’s talked about wanting to get back into art again, which shows how much creativity still matters to him.</p>

        <p>Tyler is motivated by the future — what’s ahead and what’s possible. While he doesn’t have any specific goals he’s working toward right now, he strongly believes in not giving up and staying committed to what you start. That mindset really reflects who he is.</p>

        <p>Two teachers had a big influence on Tyler’s life: his 9th-grade art teacher and his 9th-grade biology teacher. They helped shape his interests and left a lasting impact on him. One challenge he once faced was being stranded on a boat in the middle of a lake, which forced him and others to swim and push it to shore. It’s a great example of his straightforward, problem-solving attitude.</p>

        <p>More than anything, Tyler values laughter, friendships, and shared memories. He’s known for his dad jokes — like joking about dreaming he was floating in a “Fanta sea” — and his ability to bring humor and positivity into everyday life.</p>
